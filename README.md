### Assets and 3rd party components:

- [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components)  by: @glenmaddern, @mxstbr, @_philplâ€¬ [website](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- Graphics engine by [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) created by Lauren McCarthy developed by a community of collaborators with support from the Processing Foundation and NYU ITP.
- [React p5 wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-p5-wrapper) lets you integrate p5 Sketches into your React App 
- [P5js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/p5) for react: is a fundamental react-p5-wrapper dependency.

### NB. **About specific versions and performance issues:**
>The modification to this project's package json has to do with:
>- React-P5-wrapper specific peer package version dependencies
>- P5@0.5.14 incorporated changes that affect the performance considerably. So the SEM versioning is frozen @0.5.12 specifically in package.json preventing any patch releases (**^**0.5.12 in previous package.json was effectively allowing installation of any later *patch release* and thus causing the performance issue).
>- In oder to ensure that developers get the exact (node_modules) tree that was generated for this project such that when developers subsequently run **`npm i`** | **`npm install`** are able to generate identical trees *(regardless of intermediate dependency updates)*: Using npm **5.3.0** (most current) as of this writing generated a comprehensive **package.lock.json** file. (cf.[package.lock.json | npm Documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package-lock.json)).
>- Packages that were frozen to a specific version in package.json are:
    - P5, 
    - react, 
    - react-dom, 
    - react-p5-wrapper, 
    - react-redux, 
    - redux,
    - redux-logger 
    
### Final notes:
>- It was challenging building the **object-oriented cell component** of the game board, and synchronizing the internal state of the game with the Redux Store. Since the p5js graphics component is a standalone React component with its own graphics workflow cycle.
>- It was a real pleasure to have found the **styled-components** for React, the idea behind styling as a component itself with locally scoped css is more coherent with React and the component oriented paradigm. Therefore I found this component to be 100% relevant to the idea of building self contained React components, for the CSS purists it also allows to inject global styles. I particularly enjoyed the power of mixing javascript code inside the CSS definition (all we ever wanted... logic inside CSS! that is very clever). Finally, I did not have to learn yet another CSS coding scheme just good old CSS plus the component leverages the power of JavaScript.

##### Sample code extract, using styled components:

```javascript
{
    &:hover {
       background: ${props => (!props.active) ? 'rgb(176, 176, 176)' : ''};
        color: ${props =>  (!props.active) ? 'rgb(26,34,34)' : ''};
        transition: ${props => (!props.active) ? 'all 0.5s ease-in' : ''};
    }
    pointer-events: ${props => (props.disable && !props.drawingBtn) ? 'none' : ''};
    border: ${props => (props.disable && !props.drawingBtn) ? '2px solid rgb(76,176,176)'  : '2px solid rgb(117,252,252)'};
}
```
